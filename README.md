# oop-project-restaurant-management
Academic project in Java course (OOP). Includes: inheritance, interfaces, data structures, exceptions, enums, singleton, serialization, JavaFx. 
The singleton class (which contains most of the code) is Restaurant.


The project is an information system for a restaurant called JavaEat. The restaurant opened up during covid-19 and therefore operates on a take-out delivery basis only.
The system database contains data on each delivery which includes delivery areas, orders, dishes and components. 
Data on all customers, delivery people and cooks is kept in the database as well. All of the data is being saved to a serialized file.


The system contains screens for two types of users: manager and customer. All users have a username and password, and would need to log in before they can do any action. 
The manager has access to all screens, and can update, delete and add data to the database.
In addition the manager can view results for queries regarding the restaurant's revenue and delivery statistics,  

The customers have limited access to the system and can view only part of the screens, such as selected queries and update personal information.
The main focus of the customer side of the system is the menu, where they can place a new order, and adjust the components to fit their requirements.
